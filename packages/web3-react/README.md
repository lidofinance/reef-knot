### @reef-knot/web3-react
This is a legacy package, which previously included various helpers and wrappers for the `web3-react` library.

The `web3-react` library is not used in Reef Knot anymore, so `@reef-knot/web3-react` was reworked to use wagmi
and now contains a few hooks and helpers for backwards compatibility.
